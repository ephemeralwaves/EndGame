EndGame 1.0.1

// About
A platform that allows two users to play the game Endgame.
Win condition checks are commented out in the code since they are incomplete.

// Rules
Pieces follow the same move rules as Chess.
Pieces can't capture other pieces.
The goal is to have all of opponent's pieces in check and for them to not have an 'escape' move. 
If all of your pieces are in check - you must move at least one piece out of it on your move.
